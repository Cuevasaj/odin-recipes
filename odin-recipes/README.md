I have learned a lot throughout my Journey using the Odin Project, I've learned basic use of github and Basic HTML. I will now be putting my knowledge to the test and I will be creating a basic website using my knowledge of HTML. I will make sure that I have efficient running code, and ensure that I stay organized and comment on my work.
