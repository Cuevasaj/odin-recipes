    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
      <li>3 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a large
        roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken and potatoes in a large bowl. Add lemon juice, olive oil,
        garlic, dried oregano, salt, rosemary, black pepper, and cayenne. Toss
        until chicken and potatoes are evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken pieces skin-side up in the prepared pan. Tuck potato
        pieces around chicken. Drizzle with 2/3 cup chicken broth. Spoon any
        remaining marinade from the bowl over chicken and potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Toss chicken and potatoes,
        then place chicken skin-side up again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue baking until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 25
        minutes more; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should
        register 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a serving platter and keep warm; leave potatoes in
        the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on the broiler or set the oven to the highest heat. Toss potatoes
        again to coat in pan juices. Place the pan under the broiler and broil
        until potatoes are crisped, about
      </li>
